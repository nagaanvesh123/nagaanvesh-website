                        <h2>Software Testing Certification</h2>
                        <p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Manual Testing, STLC, Test Case Design</p>
                        <p>
                            I have comprehensive training in Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), 
                            with strong expertise in designing and executing detailed test cases. My focus includes defect life cycle management, 
                            black box testing techniques, regression testing, integration testing, ensuring thorough 
                            coverage across multiple phases of testing. I specialize in applying structured approaches to test planning and execution, 
                            enabling effective defect detection, improved release confidence, and consistent alignment with business and quality objectives.

                    <div class="card">
                        <h2>API Testing with Postman</h2>
                        <p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> REST API Validation & Backend Testing</p>
                        <p>
                            I have hands-on experience in REST API testing using Postman, with a strong focus on validating 
                            request-response cycles, backend data integrity, and business logic. My expertise includes JSON 
                            schema validation, simulating workflows through chained API calls, and applying collection-based 
                            execution strategies for efficient test management. I also ensure robust backend behavior through 
                            status code verification, error handling, and debugging, while leveraging data-driven testing with 
                            environment variables and external datasets to deliver stable and reliable API performance across releases.

                        <h2>Agile & Scrum Fundamentals</h2>
                        <p><strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Sprint Planning, JIRA Workflow Management</p>
                        <p>
                            I have practical exposure to Agile methodology, actively participating in Sprint Planning, Daily Standups,
                            Backlog Grooming, and Retrospectives to drive iterative improvements in product quality. My responsibilities
                            included managing and tracking defects through JIRA workflows, and timely resolution. By collaborating closely 
                            with cross-functional teams, I contributed to smoother sprint execution, improved backlog prioritization through structured Agile 
                            practices. Additionally, I supported continuous improvement initiatives by sharing insights and refining QA 
                            processes to align with evolving project needs.
